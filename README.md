What is Northcoders News v2?
Northcoders News v2 is a mobile-first web application which recreates the front-end of a project made at my time at Northcoders with TypeScript Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be the front-end of a news app with similar functionality to Reddit.com. The app consumes my Northrcoders News API to fetch its data.

The home page of the app presents users with a preview of articles which can be filtered by topic using the nav bar. Clicking on an article preview brings the user to an article page, where the full article text is displayed. The user can like or dislike the article they are reading and also create, view and delete comments.

The App makes use of:

Rendering stratgeies: Server Side Rending & Incremental Static Regeneration
Next.js directory routing
Fetch API
Responsive CSS and mobile first design using Tailwind CSS
Optimistic rendering
Conditional rendering
Live version!
